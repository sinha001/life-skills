# Good Practices for Software Development

## Question 1: Which point(s) were new to you?

The new points for me were:

- Writing down requirements and sharing them with the team even if no tool like Jira or Trello is used.
- Using screenshots, screen recordings, and tools like GitHub gists or CodeSandbox while asking questions.
- Over-communicating small issues like internet or power problems instead of assuming it’s okay.
- Tracking time using apps to improve focus and productivity.
- Managing food, exercise, and notifications to maintain concentration during work.

## Question 2: Which area do you think you need to improve on? What are your ideas to make progress in that area?

I need to improve on over-communication and asking better questions when stuck.

To improve:

- I will clearly explain the problem and mention what I have already tried before asking for help.
- I will use screenshots, code snippets, or screen recordings to make it easier for others to help.
- I will inform the team early if something is taking longer or if there are connectivity issues.
- I will prefer group channels instead of private messages for work discussions.
