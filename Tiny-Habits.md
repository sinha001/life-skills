# Tiny Habits

## 1. Tiny Habits - BJ Fogg

### 1. In this video, what was the most interesting story or idea for you?

The idea that really stood out to me the "tiny seed" metaphor - how planting a small behavior in the right place can grow naturally without forcing yourself. That was powerful.

## 2. Tiny Habits by Bj Fogg - Core Message

### 2. How can you use B = MAP to make making new habits easier? What are M, A and P.

- B = MAP
  where,
  M = Motivation,
  A = Ability,
  P = Prompts (Trigger)

  Your behavior (B) happens only when motivation, ability, and a prompt come together at the same moment.

- B = MAP can be used effectively by doing the following:
  - Shrink the behavior (make it tiny)
    - Do the smallest possible version of the habit.
    - Tiny habits need less motivation, so they are easier to start.
    - Reduce the quantity or just do the first step.
  - Identify an action prompt
    - Avoid external prompts (notifications, reminders) and internal prompts (mood, feelings) because they’re unreliable.

    - Choose an action prompt, meaning you attach your new tiny habit to an existing daily action.

        - Example: “After I start my morning coffee, I will set out my vitamins.”
  - Grow your habit with some shine.

    - Celebrate immediately after completing your tiny habit.
    - Celebration helps your brain feel successful and makes the behavior stick.
    - Skipping celebration makes habit formation slower.


### 3. Why it is important to "Shine" or Celebrate after each successful completion of habit? (This is the most important concept in today's topic. Whatever you celebrate becomes a habit)

- Celebrating makes you feel good, and that feeling helps the habit stick.

- Your brain sees the action as something rewarding, so you want to do it again.

- “Shine” boosts your confidence and keeps you motivated.

- Without celebrating, habits take longer to form.

- Whatever you celebrate becomes a habit because your brain starts wanting that positive feeling again.

## 3. 1% Better Every Day Video

### 4. In this video, what was the most interesting story or idea for you?

For me, the most interesting idea was when James Clear talked about Identity change.
He said that real change happens when you stop focusing only on goals and start focusing on who you want to become.

Like: 
- Don't just try to read a book -> become a reader.
- Don't just try to write a book -> become a writer.
- Don't just try to run a marathon -> become a runner.

This hit me because it's so true. When you see yourself as the kind of person who does the habit, the habit becomes easier. You don't have to push yourself everyday--it starts to feel natural.

And the line "Every action is a vote for the type of person you wish to become" stuck with me the most. It makes small daily steps feel meaningful.

## 4. Book Summary of Atomic Habits

### 5. What is the book’s perspective about Identity?

The book says that real change starts with your identity, not your goals.
Instead of focusing on what you want to achieve, focus on the type of person you want to become.

Example:

- Don’t aim to “read 20 books.” Aim to “become a reader.”

- Don’t aim to “run 5 km.” Aim to “become a runner.”

Every small habit you do is like a vote for the identity you want.
The more you repeat a habit, the more you start believing, “This is who I am.”

### 6. How to make a habit easier to do?

The book says the best way to make a habit easier is to make it tiny and remove obstacles.

- Break the habit into the smallest possible version.
(Read 1 page, do 1 push-up, write 1 sentence.)

- Reduce friction — make the habit simple to start.
(Keep your gym clothes ready, keep a book on your bed.)

- Use the “2-minute rule” — make the first step take less than 2 minutes.

- Set up your environment so the habit fits naturally into your day.

When a habit is easy, your motivation doesn’t matter — you will still do it.

### 7. How to make a habit harder to do?

For bad habits, do the opposite — make them difficult and less tempting.

- Remove the cues or triggers.
(Don’t keep snacks on your desk. Keep your phone in another room.)

- Add friction — make the habit take more steps.
(Log out of apps, uninstall addictive apps.)

- Make the habit unattractive — remind yourself why it’s bad for you.

- Make it unsatisfying — no immediate reward.

When a habit becomes hard, your brain automatically does it less.

## 5. Reflection

### 8. Pick one habit that you would like to do more of? What are the steps that you can take to make it make the cue obvious or the habit more attractive or easy and or response satisfying?

Habit: Reading every day.

**Steps I can take to make it easier and more attractive:**

- I will keep a book on my bed or table so the cue is obvious.

- I will start with a tiny version: read just 1 page a day.

- I will attach it to an existing habit:
“After I finish dinner, I will read for 2 minutes.”

- I will make the environment simple — no phone near me while reading.

- I will make it satisfying by marking the day on a habit tracker so I “don’t break the chain.”

### 9. Pick one habit that you would like to eliminate or do less of? What are the steps that you can take to make it make the cue invisible or the process unattractive or hard or the response unsatisfying?

**Habit to reduce:**  Scrolling social media too much.

**Steps to make it harder or less attractive:**

- I will keep my phone in another room while studying or reading.

- I will log out of apps and turn off notifications so the cue becomes invisible.

- I will uninstall the most distracting apps from the home screen.

- I will add friction: use app timers, or require a password for opening apps.

- I will remind myself how scrolling affects my focus, so it feels unattractive.

- I will replace scrolling with a better tiny habit (like reading 1 page).
