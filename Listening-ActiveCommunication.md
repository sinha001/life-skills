## 2. According to Fisher's model, what are the key points of Reflective Listening? (Write in your own words, use simple English)

- You have to focus fully on the other person. No need to interupt, judge or plan your reply while they are talking.

- You repeat back the main idea in your own words. This helps the speaker to know that you heard them correctly.

- Try to understand the feelings, not just the words.

- No need to jump in with solutions. Give the person space to express themselves fully.

- Try to be patient and calm. Let the speaker take time to think and talk.

- Try to make sure what you have understood is correct.

- Try to see the situation from the speaker's view. Let them feel respested and understood.
