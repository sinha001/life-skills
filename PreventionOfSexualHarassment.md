# Prevention of Sexual Harassment

## What kinds of behaviour cause sexual harassment?
Sexual harassment means **any unwanted behaviour of a sexual nature** that makes someone feel uncomfortable, unsafe, embarrassed, or disrespected.

This can include:
- **Unwanted physical contact** like touching, hugging, or standing too close.
- **Sexual comments or jokes**, remarks about someone’s body or appearance.
- **Staring, gestures, or expressions** that make a person uncomfortable.
- **Sharing or showing inappropriate photos, videos, messages, or emojis.**
- **Sending unwanted emails or messages** with sexual content.
- **Asking for sexual favours** in return for promotions, appraisals, or job benefits.
- **Repeated behaviour** that creates fear or discomfort, even if it looks small each time.

If a person does not welcome the behaviour and it affects their dignity, it is considered sexual harassment.

## What would you do in case you face or witness any incident or repeated incidents of such behaviour?
If I face sexual harassment:
- I would clearly say that the behaviour **is not acceptable**, if I feel safe.
- I would **note down details** like date, time, and what happened.
- I would report the issue to the **Internal Complaints Committee (ICC)** or HR.
- I would seek help without fear of punishment or blame.

If I **witness sexual harassment**:
- I would **support the affected person** and encourage them to speak up.
- If safe, I would try to **stop the behaviour** or speak against it.
- I would report the incident to the **ICC or management**.
- I would respect privacy and not blame the victim.

Everyone at the workplace is responsible for **creating a safe, respectful, and harassment-free environment**.
