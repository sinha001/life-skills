## 2. In this video, what was the most interesting story or idea for you?

- In this video, the most interesting idea for me was how learning can be improved using a technique like Active Recall, where you read something, look away, and try to remember it from memory.

- I also found it fascinating that even slow learners can succeed by practising this method.

- Additionally, the concept of switching between focused and relaxed modes of thinking shows that taking breaks and letting your brain rest is an important part of learning deeply. These ideas made me realize that struggle and mistakes are actually signs of effective learning.


## 3. What are active and diffused modes of thinking?

- ### Active Mode (Focused):
    - This is when you concentrate hard on thing.
    - You pay full attention and think carefully, step by step.
    - Example: Solving a math problem or reading something difficult.

- ### Diffused Mode (Relaxed):
    - This is when your brain is relaxed and not focusing on one thing.
    - Your mind can connect ideas freely and come up with creative solutions. 
    - Examples: Taking a walk, daydreaming, or relaxing after studying.

## 4. According to the video, what are the steps to take when approaching a new topic? Only mention the points.

- The steps to take when approaching a new topic are:
 
    - Don't try to learn everything at once. Focus on the most important pieces first.

    - Get enough basic knowledge so you can tell when you are doing something wrong and correct it.

    - Make it easy to practise by removing distractions or getting the tools you need.

    - Spend focused time practising. Around 20 hours of practice helps you get a basic level of skill.

## 5. What are some of the actions you can take going forward to improve your learning process?

- Keep your phone on silent and avoid distractions like social media.

- Decide how much time to spend on each topic or assignment and stick to it.

- Ask yourself: Where is this used? Can I explain it in my own words? Can I use it in code?

- Do exercises, assignments, or projects on time to remember what you learn.

- Learn in a way that works for you and enjoy the process.

- Explaining things to others helps you understand better.

- Master some skills well instead of trying to do everything.

- Don't wait, communicate clearly if you face problems.
